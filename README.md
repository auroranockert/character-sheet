Pathfinder / Birthright Character Sheet
================================================================================

Birthright / Pathfinder (but possibly easily adapted for other pathfinder
campaign settings) character sheet designed in LaTeX and I intend to use it for
my next campaign.


Notes
================================================================================

I am using a Birthright logo (birthright.png) on my sheets, but it is missing
in the repository because I am not sure if WotC allows us to use it on our own
products. But you can swap it out for a logo relevant for your campaign easily.


Credits
================================================================================

I borrowed some small bits and pieces from nasfarley88's pathfinder [sheet][1]
